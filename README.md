Listy is a manager for all your tasks. Like a todo list, but more dynamic. It allows you to add sub tasks and also has features:

[Day.Month] Adds a date to a task.

[link, name] or [link] Adds a link to the task with a name, if specified.

[weekDays, 0 1 2 3 4 5 6] Resets the task at these weekdays. Monday is 0. [weekDays, 0 1 4 6] will reset at Monday, Tuesday, Friday and sunday. By reset I mean make the task be undone.

[cycle] Resets every day.

You can also add text to each task by clicking the text symbol of the task.
The green checkmark will toggle the view, meaning the done tasks will be either shown or not.

All tasks will be saved, meaning you don't have to worry about losing them.

I'm planning on making an app for macOs too soon.
